🔹 1. Fixed Investor Profile Query

- Rewrote SQL using a WITH clause

- Correctly aggregates:

- Total investments

- Total capital deployed

- Sector breakdown

- Recent deals

- Co-investors

- Added new SQL query to rank investors by:

- Deal count

- Total investment

- Related startup names

Output Example:

1. Sequoia — 12 deals, $1.4B invested
   • Startups: OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, …

🔹 3. Unified Chatbot Formatter (Major Upgrade)

The formatting engine now:

- Detects query type

- Builds structured markdown (titles, lists, highlights, tables)

- Includes follow-up question suggestions

- Handles empty/missing fields gracefully

- Supports modular sections:

- summary

- table

- highlights

- suggested_followups

🔹 4. Improved Routing Layer

- Updated the "Route by Query Type" node to support:

- top_investors

- investor_profile

- recent_funding

- Routing is now precise and bug-free.

🔹 5. Updated UI with:

- Cleaner formatting
